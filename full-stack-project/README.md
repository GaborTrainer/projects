It's a really simple java application, based on an MVC pattern.

- URL mapped (Jakarta Server Pages (JSP))
- Based on an MVC pattern
- Object oriented
- Uses database (MariaDB, Flyway)

So it's a 3 paged application, with a minimal design, and database access,
which is URL mapped, and based on an MVC pattern.
